TRADING PSYCHOLOGY - KEY CONCEPTS

=== FEAR & GREED ===
When Fear & Greed Index shows extreme greed (>75), the market is often
near a local top. This is when retail investors are most bullish and 
professional traders start taking profits.

Extreme fear (<25) often marks bottoms. When everyone is panicking,
that's when the best opportunities appear.

=== RSI AND PSYCHOLOGY ===
RSI above 70 combined with extreme greed is a warning sign. The market
is overbought and overleveraged. Wait for a pullback.

RSI below 30 with extreme fear suggests oversold conditions and potential
reversal. However, in strong downtrends, RSI can stay low for extended periods.

=== MARK DOUGLAS - TRADING IN THE ZONE ===
"The market's job is to extract money from the majority. If everyone expects
the market to go up, it will likely do the opposite."

"Trade probabilities, not predictions. No single trade matters."

=== WHALE BEHAVIOR ===
When large holders (whales) are accumulating while retail is fearful,
it's a strong buy signal. When whales distribute during euphoria, be cautious.

High volume combined with price increase suggests institutional buying.
High volume with price decrease suggests distribution.

=== FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) ===
FOMO typically appears near tops. When your friends start asking about crypto,
when news is extremely bullish, when social media is euphoric - these are
warning signs, not entry signals.

The best entries happen when nobody is talking about crypto.

=== RISK MANAGEMENT ===
Never risk more than 2% of your capital on a single trade.
Always use stop losses.
Position sizing is more important than entry timing.
